<p style="text-align: center;">
  The Loudness trying to fight
  Instincts of throwing dice
  I'm trying to navigate
  Before it's gone too late

  Your black nails find my sight
  Your hair that's all dyed
  The way that you can hide
  From the lights out tonight

  It's the light that just goes on
  It's the light that just goes on
  Just footsteps dying out
  Drying notions, it's so loud

  Thoughts and lies
  And figures of speech
  Don't tie yourself to me
  Throw you in a ditch

  In the cement, parking lot
  Bleeding out you're gray
  Worthless and meaningless
  You're left in a daze

  Drips of memory leave your body
  Melting away your brain
  They just repeat everything you say
  The Cult of Amnesia you laid

  Laugh it off
  Laugh it off
